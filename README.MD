# BITSO CryptoSpanish SkillServer 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hellerox/alexa-bitso.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hellerox/alexa-bitso)

A simple alexa/echo skillserver developed in go using [`go-alexa`](https://github.com/mikeflynn/go-alexa) awesome framework, and BITSO Public API.

## Update
- v0.1 - First version, it returns text only in spanish (Mexican Amazon skills) and has ETH_MXN, BTC_MXN, XRP_MXN pairs from bitso, and BTC_USDT pair from binance.

## Deployment
- It is deployed in a free heroku, I don't know exactly how to test it locally.

## Future enhancements
- More languages
- More pairs, maybe simpler intents? and more precise recognition of current intents
- Cleaner code: lint, tests, mocks
- Better structure


--- For now it is just an exercise for me and I plan to make it a lot better
